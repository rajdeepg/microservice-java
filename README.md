# Autodesk Drive Microservice

Autodesk Drive is a cloud storage service targeted at individual users that allows basic file & folder operations, sync to desktop, viewing, and basic sharing (both public and drive sharing). It can be compared to Google Drive, Dropbox, Box, Onedrive and so on. It is unlike these alternative 3rd party offerings since Autodesk Drive can manage/understand design file relationships, support design data viewing, and design public sharing. A future requirement will be to support private sharing of files, folders, and designs.

Since Autodesk Drive is intended to be leveraged by individuals, it is not intended to be used as a master storage location for shipping product/project design data. Similar to Microsofts OneDrive (for Individuals) and Sharepoint (for Teams), once a customer requires a solution to handle production design data they should switch to Fusion, BIM, or Shotgun.
